This repository contains the coursework and projects I completed during my studies in the AIM-5005 Machine Learning course at the Katz School of Science and Health. In this course, I was introduced to the cutting-edge field of machine learning, including its various models and algorithms, as well as practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios. Please feel free to explore this repository and provide any feedback you may have. Thank you for your interest!
